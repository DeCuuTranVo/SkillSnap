SkillSnap: A Modern Portfolio Management Platform

SkillSnap is a comprehensive portfolio management system designed to help professionals create, manage, and showcase their portfolios online. Built with Blazor WebAssembly and ASP.NET Core Web API, the application provides a modern, responsive platform where users can effectively present their skills, projects, and professional profiles to potential employers or clients.

The application delivers robust functionality through its dual-component architecture. Users are able to create detailed professional portfolios that include biographical information, profile images, and contact details. The platform enables comprehensive project management, allowing users to add, edit, and display projects with rich descriptions, images, and technical specifications. Additionally, SkillSnap provides sophisticated skills tracking capabilities, enabling users to categorize and rate their technical competencies across four proficiency levels: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert.

Beyond basic portfolio functionality, SkillSnap offers secure user authentication with registration and login capabilities, ensuring data privacy and user-specific content management. The platform supports real-time updates, providing dynamic content synchronization across the user interface for a seamless user experience.

Three key features distinguish SkillSnap as a modern portfolio management solution. First, SkillSnap provides comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for all portfolio elements. Users can fully manage their profiles, projects, and skills with intuitive interfaces, including image support for projects and detailed skill proficiency tracking. Second, the application implements advanced security and authentication measures. It uses JWT-based authentication with role-based authorization, featuring a multi-tier system for Admin and User roles. Integration with ASP.NET Core Identity ensures robust user management, password complexity requirements, and secure API endpoints with proper authorization checks. Third, SkillSnap incorporates performance optimization and testing. The platform features sophisticated caching mechanisms with server-side memory caching to improve API response times. It includes cache hit/miss testing with performance metrics, Entity Framework query optimizations, and an interactive testing suite that validates cache performance and system scalability under various load conditions.

In summary, SkillSnap combines professional presentation, security, and high performance to deliver a powerful platform for portfolio management.
